    Read a YAML file at `path` and update the configuration with its values.

    Overwrite default values set in `ConfigEntry` objects with values from the YAML file. A YAML node overwrites an
    attribute of a `ConfigEntry` if their paths are equal. The path of the node is the dot-delimited concatenation of
    its parents' keys with its own key. In the following example, the path of the node 'class' is 'module.class'.

    module:
      class:
        attribute_1: value

    Nodes may be fully expanded (like above), partially collapsed, or fully collapsed. A `ConfigEntry` node's definition
    could be split by using different levels of expansion. For example,

    module:
      class:
        attribute_1: value

    module.class:
      attribute_2: value

    module.class:
      attribute_3: value

    would overwrite `attribute_1` and `attribute_3` of the `ConfigEntry` for the path 'package.module'. When a key is
    defined multiple times, the last definition is the one used. Therefore, `attribute_2` is not included.

    The YAML does not strictly have to contain nodes that correspond to `ConfigEntry` objects. For example, it's valid
    to have a non-`ConfigEntry` node marked by an anchor which is later referenced in some node that does correspond to
    a `ConfigEntry`. There could be nodes that are simply not used at all. It's even valid for the root to not be a
    mapping node. Such file would effectively configure nothing, but loading it is still supported.

    A !REF constructor can be used to reference another attribute of a `ConfigEntry`. For example,

    module_1:
      class:
        attribute_1: value

    module_2:
      class:
        attribute_2: !REF module_1.class.attribute_1

    would make `attribute_2` have the same value as `attribute_1`. As described above, the value of `attribute_1`
    follows the same behaviour expected for any other attribute.

    Args:
        path: The path to the configuration file.
        encoding: The encoding with which to open the file. Same as the `encoding` parameter of the `open()` built-in.
            PyYAML only supports utf-16-le, utf-16-be, and utf-8. utf-8 is assumed if the former two are not detected.
        yaml_loader: The YAML loader to use. Default to a full loader with the !REF constructor added.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: The configuration file doesn't exist.
        IOError: An error occurred while reading the file.
        yaml.YAMLError: PyYAML failed to load the YAML.
        ConfigurationError: A !REF constructor contains a circular reference.
